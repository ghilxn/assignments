# a. Using multiple print() statements
print("All the world's a stage,")
print("And all the men and women merely players:")
print("They have their exits and their entrances;")
print("And one man in his time plays many parts,")
print("His acts being seven ages.")

# b. Single print with

print("\nAll the world's a stage,\nAnd all the men and women merely players:\nThey have their exits and their entrances;\nAnd one man in his time plays many parts,\nHis acts being seven ages.")

# c. Output of print("127","0","0","1", sep=".") is 127.0.0.1

# flush=True: makes Python show the output right away
# print("Loading...", flush=True)

# flush=False: normal printing (waits and shows when ready)
# print("Done!", flush=False)

# flush is usually off
# but when we use end="\n" (new line),
# print() acts like flush=True


# One challenge I faced was getting used to PyCharm since I have never used it before.

# Remembering to use \n for line breaks in a single print() statement was confusing at first.

# Understanding flush=True and flush=False was tricky because I didnâ€™t know what buffering meant.

# I had to re-read the instructions a few times to make sure I was putting answers in the right format.
